Create a flask app
One endpoint --- localhost:3000/analyze?algo="bubble"&n=1000&steps=10
Takes query params: 
 - The algo to be analyzed (bubblesort,linear search, binary, nested/exponential)
 - The value of n (elements)
 - The step value (n_steps)
 
Responds with:
 - Formatted json  (all the above context including how long it took to run the analisis (Total time))
 - And a base 64 stream of the image  of the graph



 example of json

  "end_time":24898765,
